import pdb          import the pdb module
pdb.set_trace()     Halt execution and start the debugging tool at this point. Will open a new terminal window.

Commands
========

l                   Display a code listing indicating the next line of code to execute
n                   Execute the next line of code
q                   Quit debugger
c                   Stop debugger and continue with code execution
'variable vame'     Enter the name of a variable to display the current value. If the variable name conflicts with a pdb command, pdb will execute the command
                    and not display the value of variable. To be safe use command:  p 'variable name'
p 'variable name'   Print the value of 'variable name'
a                   Display value of all variables.
